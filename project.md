${{ content_synopsis }} This image will run the Netbird client as a container [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) to be used as an exit-node or side car. Generating a [setup key](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/register-machines-using-setup-keys) is all you need to do.

${{ content_uvp }} Good question! Because ...

${{ github:> [!CAUTION] }}
${{ github:> }}* This image is rootless and runs in userspace (not kernel space). Use this image as an **exit node** or attach to another container to expose that container via Netbird. Do not use this image as a normal netbird client, use [11notes/netbird-client](https://github.com/11notes/docker-netbird-client) for that.
